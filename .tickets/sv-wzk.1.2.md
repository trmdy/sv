# sv risk --simulate: conflict simulation mode

Implement sv risk --simulate:
- For selected workspace pairs or 'stack onto base'
- Run virtual merge simulation
- Report files with conflicts and conflict type
- Emit machine-readable JSON for automation
- Show summary of which workspace pairs would conflict

Acceptance: sv risk --simulate shows true merge conflicts without modifying files
