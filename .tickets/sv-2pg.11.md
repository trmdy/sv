# Dry-run/preview UX design (optional)

Draft a design note for a future `--dry-run`/`--preview` flag:
- Candidate commands: take, release, protect add/off, ws new/rm.
- Expected output behavior in human/JSON modes.
- Safety benefits and how it fits with event output.

Why: premium tools offer confidence-building previews for risky actions.


## Acceptance Criteria

Design note added describing which commands get --dry-run, expected output behavior, and interaction with --json/--events.
