# Add sv ws switch UX + worktree path template + shell integration

Add a sv ws switch UX like worktrunk: branch-addressed worktree switching/creation, shortcuts (^ default, - previous, @ current), and --execute to launch a command after switch; add user-configurable worktree path template + sanitize filter + env overrides; must be additive and keep existing sv ws new/list/here workflows unchanged.
