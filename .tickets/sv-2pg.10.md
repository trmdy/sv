# Help text + onboarding examples alignment

Coordinate with sv-8jf.9.2 to ensure help text examples are:
- Consistent with the output style guide (sv-2pg.1).
- Focused on common flows (init → take → commit, ws new → risk → hoist).
- Including flag usage for --json/--events and error‑handling guidance.

Why: discoverability is a major UX lever for CLI tools.


## Acceptance Criteria

Help text examples align with output style guide; no duplication with sv-8jf.9.2; examples include common flows (init → take → commit) and show flags.
